Scala is concise
- Less repetition and syntactic noise means faster prototyping and greater
  readability.

Scala lets you choose programming style
- Scala is well prepared for both imperative and functional programming,
  object oriented or not. Uniform syntax allows to prototype code in any
  style and refactor it quickly to another style.

Scala is strongly typed
- Scala's powerful type system can be leveraged to encode more invariants
  directly in the code, catching bugs at the earliest possible moment.

Scala is interoperable
- Single Scala codebase can be compiled to JVM, JS and LLVM
- Scala seamlessly interoperate with Java libraries
- Scala.js allows efficient cooperation with JavaScript libraries
- Scala Native allows efficient cooperation with C-based APIs
